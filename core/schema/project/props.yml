# shotgun filters to apply when getting the list of items
# this should be a list of dicts, each dict containing
# three fields: path, relation and values
# (this is std shotgun API syntax)
# any values starting with $ are resolved into path objects
filters:
    - { "path": "project", "relation": "is", "values": [ "$project" ] }
    - { "path": "code", "relation": "not_in", "values": [ "sequence"] }
    - { "path": "code", "relation": "not_in", "values": [ "_admin","_editorial","_presentation","_source_global","_ref","_prod"] }
